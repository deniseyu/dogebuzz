# Fizzbuzz in DogeScript

DogeScript docs: https://github.com/dogescript/dogescript

I have no idea how to test this. I'm not even 100% sure the syntax is correct. It could afford to be much more doge-like.

It doesn't test or run properly yet in shell. This is for pure entertainment purposes, and to give my ibuprofen-addled brain at 5am something to do.

In theory, to use the Dogescript to JS compiler in shell:

```
npm install -g dogescript
```

then from your project directory,

```
dogescript filename.djs
```

# Fizzbuzz in DogeScript

DogeScript docs: https://github.com/dogescript/dogescript

I have no idea how to test this. I'm not even 100% sure the syntax is correct. It could afford to be much more doge-like.

This is for pure entertainment purposes, and to give my ibuprofen-addled brain at 5am something to do.

To use the Dogescript to JS compiler in shell:

```
npm install -g dogescript
git clone git@github.com:deniseyu/dogebuzz.git
cd dogebuzz
```

then from your project directory,

```
dogescript lib/dogebuzz.djs
```

To write the output to a new file, wow such compile

```
dogescript lib/dogebuzz.djs > lib/dogebuzz.js
```
